# Neon RFCs

A Neon RFC ("Request For Comments") is a proposal for a significant change to the Neon design or architecture.

Many changes, such as bug fixes and documentation improvements, can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes are substantial, and we ask that these be put through a bit of design process in order to build consensus amongst the Neon community.

The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent, well-considered path for features and changes to make it into the project, so that all stakeholders can feel confident about the direction of the project.
